### Introduction

The first step for building any website is having the right tools. For us, that means setting up a development environment for writing good code.

### Code editors


While we already have Vs Code, having an online development environment can be useful for when we need to code with our mobile phone.

In this case we simply  use in-browser code editors or “sandboxes,” which give you the tools and programs needed to accomplish the task at hand and nothing else.

You’ll use some of these in browser code editors throughout the early stages of The Grassroot Project since they’re great for getting started quickly

Our pick is [replit.com](https://replit.com/), a super power in browser code editor accessible with mobile phone , tablet or pc.

All you need is a browser and an internet connection. No set up required.

Simply head to [replit.com](https://replit.com/), create an account, ensure you save your email and password.
